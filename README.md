Domain: Data Analytics 
Mentor: Neela Santosh Kumar

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this analysis is to build a simple linear regression model to predict the median house value (MedHouseVal) based on the average number of rooms per dwelling (AveRooms) in the California housing dataset.

Key Features
1.Data Loading and Preparation:
-Load the California housing dataset using fetch_california_housing.
-Create a DataFrame from the dataset and add the target variable MedHouseVal.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

3.Feature Selection:
-Use AveRooms as the single feature for simplicity.

4.Data Splitting:
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split with an 80-20 split.

5.Model Building and Training:
-Create a linear regression model using LinearRegression.
-Train the model on the training data.

6.Model Evaluation:
-Make predictions on the test set.
-Calculate performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

7.Visualization:
-Plot the regression line on a scatter plot of the test data.
-Plot actual vs. predicted values to visually assess model performance.
